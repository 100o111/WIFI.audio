    <h1>Privacy Policy for wifi.audio</h1>
    
    <div class="tldr">
      <h2>TL;DR</h2>
      <p>Don't worry, we're not hacking your phone or spying on you. We just need your name so we know who's who during the experience. Your microphone is only used on your own device to create sounds, we never record or send that audio anywhere. Your camera is used to activate the flashlight (only if you have an Android phone), and we also don't record or send any video recording of yours. We can't access any of your files or personal data. The wifi connection just lets your phone talk to our local server during the event, and we use network activity to create audio-visual effects. So relax and enjoy the experience!</p>
